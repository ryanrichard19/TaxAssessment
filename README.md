# TaxAssessment

Used a Sqlite Database
    -Used a database first approach
    
The Backend API 
    - Should start up on https://localhost:5001/
    - Implemented Swagger for testing of the API
    - Used Entity Framework as my ORM
    - Implemented a the statergy pattern for the tax calculator which allows for other tax types to be added easily. 

The UI Front End
    - Should start up on https://localhost:5003/
    - Done in .net core MVC.

There is still alot of room for improvement i.e better validations and exception handling. Implementation of an automapper so that one does not have to do it mannualy. 

I hope this is ok as I have not spent much time on it.
